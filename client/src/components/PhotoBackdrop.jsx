/**
 * A section whose background is a photograph, with a scrim that guarantees the
 * text on top stays readable.
 *
 * The scrim is the whole point: it holds near-solid page colour across the text
 * column and releases the image beyond it, so contrast never depends on which
 * part of the photograph happens to sit behind a given word. Both curves are
 * tuned per theme in index.css.
 *
 * Use this only where text sits on a photograph. Where nothing has to stay
 * readable, render the image on its own — a scrim with no text to protect is
 * the effect copied without the reason for it.
