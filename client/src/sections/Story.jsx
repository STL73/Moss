// The photograph was a rounded card beside the copy, which read as an
// illustration of the section. Full-bleed behind a scrim, it reads as the
// setting the copy is describing.
//
// It was the creek until 2026-08-16. That photograph moved to the
// hero as the opening shot of the camera move, and this section took the wide
// arrangement instead, which suits it better: "Our process" is about a finished
// piece, not a hillside.

                    Every piece begins with moss gathered under licence from managed Nordic
                    woodland, taken in small quantities so the ground recovers before we return.

                    In the studio it is cleaned and preserved with a plant-based glycerin
                    solution. That halts ageing permanently, so the moss keeps its colour and
                    softness for years with no water and no light.
